                <p>Hi, I’m Chloe 👋🏻😬 Welcome to my first 3D interactive website.
                    I’m a student at the University of Washington. Even though I’m majoring in CS major, I’ve always enjoyed art since I was little. 
                    (Fun fact about me, I’ve never participated in an art or design class) I love being creative and creating content that brings joy to others and makes them feel calm and relaxed. 
                    I’m so glad that you make it here! I hope you’ll have a cozy experience at my website!
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Oh! By the way! The website is still in development stage 🤧 Hopefully I can complete it in Jan. But you can check out my Instagram for more cool stuff! I'll see you there!
